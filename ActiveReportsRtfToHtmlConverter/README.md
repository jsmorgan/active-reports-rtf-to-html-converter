# active-reports-rtf-to-html-converter
A converter to update Active Reports RTF fields to HTML fields

## Running the utility
Run the program and pass in the absolute path to the directory you want to process.

## About
This is provided as is and was only used for one project migrating active reports 10 to 18.
During the transition we realised that many of the fields were simple not displaying on the migrated reports.
This utility seeks to automate the process of migrating the RTF fields to Html content so your old reports will function on a newer system.
